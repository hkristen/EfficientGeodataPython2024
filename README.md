# EfficientGeodataPython
In this course, spatially relevant questions are addressed through structured programming in Python. The fundamental principles of the programming language are taught and reinforced with practical exercises. Special emphasis is placed on the manipulation (importing, analyzing, editing, exporting) of geodata in both vector and raster formats.

This course was taught as a BSC level course called [Efficient Geodata Manipulation with Python](https://online.uni-graz.at/kfu_online/ee/ui/ca2/app/desktop/#/slc.tm.cp/student/courses/834856) in the summer semester of 2024 at the Institute of Geography / University of Graz by Harald Kristen & Matthias Wecht.
